I'm currently an EEE junior at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.  
Being a tech enthusiast, I'm especially interested in consumer gadgets and user interface of softwares.  
I know a little bit of Pascal, C/C++ and Python. Currently learning computer networking and building telegram bots.
